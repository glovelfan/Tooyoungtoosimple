2019/02/09     Plan:  (1) Dong finish the configuration of working environment 
                          (initialize Google Cloud and connect with it) before Monday 11th Feb.
                      (2) Fan get training data before Monday 11th Feb.
                      (3) Fan write google doc before Monday 11th Feb.
                      (4) Fan try to use TensorFlow in PC before Monday 11th Feb.
                      
           Agreement: (1) We use TensorFlow and Google Cloud as our working environment
                      (2) We initialize Google Cloud via linux.
                      (3) We three try different methods seperately 
                          (Fan: traditional DNN, Yeh: change between different time steps, Dong: time series as a whole). 
                          
2019/02/10     idea:  (1) The circus flow in a tube has a precise N-S solution, we can start from this specific case.


2019/02/12     plan:  (1) Fan: Start with the pipe flow and build DNN to verify this circumstance. Generate data for the project 
                                before 15th Feb.
                      (2) Dong: Try to represent the data for experiment 1, and start to deal with experiment 2 by Sunday (2.17)
                      (3) Paul: Bulid the Tensorflow/PyTorch on the Google Cloud, then run a simple CNN. (2.24)
